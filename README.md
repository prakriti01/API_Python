# API_Python
Based on the API calls, weather results varies. Perform the multiple calls to track results in multiple days. Results counted were not static.Analysis is based on geocentric latitude which is the angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the centre to a point on the surface. it is affected by the factors like temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed.Most likely windspeed, tempratures directly corelates the latitude.However temprature and humidity alternates towards the opposite directions.No conclusive results are indicated based on this trend.
